# StrongLoop Buildpack for OpenShift 

StrongLoop provides:
 * LoopBack, an open-source Node.js framework that enables you to create dynamic end-to-end REST APIs with little or no coding. For more information on LoopBack, see http://loopback.io.s
 * StrongLoop Controller, a Node devops system.  See [StrongLoop Controller docs](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/SLC/StrongLoop+Controller) for more information.
 * StrongLoop Agent (StrongOps), an operational console for Node.js applications that provides deep performance monitoring including CPU profiling, event loop statistics, and more.  See [StrongLoop Agent docs](http://docs.strongloop.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3834736) for more information.

Follow the steps in <a href="http://docs.strongloop.com/display/SLC/Getting+started+with+StrongLoop+Controller">Getting started</a> to install Node and the StrongLoop command-line tool, then create a StrongLoop application on your local system using the <a href="http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Create+a+simple+API">slc loopback</a> command.

Then follow the steps below to deploy the app to OpenShift.

## Trying the StrongLoop sample application

Follow these steps to get started using StrongLoop on OpenShift:

1. Login at at http://www.openshift.com/. Create an account if you don't already have one.
2. Ensure you have the latest version of the client tools. As part of this process, you'll run the `rhc setup` command and choose a unique name (called a namespace) that becomes part of your public application URL.
3. Create an application on OpenShift with the following command:
      
        $ rhc create-app yourapp https://raw.github.com/tsiry95/openshift-strongloop-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml

4. Replace "yourapp" with your application name.  You'll see the message: 

        Creating application 'yourapp' ... 

The first build will take a few minutes, so please be patient.

When it's done, you'll get a folder called `yourapp` (or whatever you chose for your app name) in your current path containing the LoopBack sample app . You'll see a friendly welcome: 

    Your application 'yourapp' is now available.

      URL:        http://yourapp-<namespace>.rhcloud.com/
      SSH to:     527...0069@yourapp-<namespace>.rhcloud.com
      Git remote: ssh://527...0069@yourapp-<namespace>.rhcloud.com/~/git/yourapp.git/
      Cloned to:  <local-path>/yourapp

Where:

  * `<namespace>` is your OpenShift namespace.
  * `<local-path>` is the path to your app's source git repository, cloned to your local system.

You can now try out the LoopBack sample application running on OpenShift: 
  
  * View the LoopBack sample app at the indicated URL that looks like http://yourapp-<namespace>.rhcloud.com/. 
  * View the LoopBack API explorer at http://yourapp-<namespace>.rhcloud.com/explorer/.
  * The default app with the buildpack is a basic loopback app without any user defined models or datasources. To add functionality to your app refer to <a href="http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Getting+Started+with+LoopBack">Getting Started with LoopBack.</a>


## Deploying your own application to OpenShift

If you created your own LoopBack application, follow these steps to replace the default app and deploy your app on OpenShift.

1. Add a start command to your package.json and commit it-
        
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node ."
    }

2. Add your application to a Git repository.

        $ git init
        $ git add -A
        $ git commit -a -m "Initial Commit"


3. Get the URL of the OpenShift app's remote Git repository by running:

    $rhc app show osapp |  grep Git 

Copy the Git URL from the output:

    Git URL:    ssh://52a17af15004464d950003bd@openshiftapp-domain.rhcloud.com/~/git/openshiftapp.git/

4. In your LoopBack app directory, enter this command, where `<remote_git_url>` is the Git URL from step 3.

    $ git remote add openshift <remote_git_url>

5. Deploy as follows:

    $ git push --force openshift master

That's it!  You can now check out your application at the app URL/domain you set for your OpenShift app.  
If you have enabled StrongOps monitoring, log in to the StrongOps dashboard at http://strongops.strongloop.com and 
you should be able to see your app.
